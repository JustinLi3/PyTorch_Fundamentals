What is Machine learnning? 
 -turning data into numbers and finding patterns within those numbers (Within AI) 
 -computer makes predictions/decisions from data without code for each task

What is Deep learning? 
 -subset of machine learning using neural networks to analyze various levels of data (like speech & image recognition) 

Traditional Programming 
 -Takes in inputs and code in order to produce output

Machine Learning Algorithm 
 -Takes in inputs and desired outputs in order to draw connections between each other to produce code

Why use Machine Learning? 
 -Writing all the code may be too cumbersome, too many rules when you would rather have the computer write 
  us an algorithm and they find the patterns for us 

Can we use it for everything? 
 -"If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that." 
 -Isnt a solve for everything 
 -Not when patterns learned not useful for human 
 -Not when errors are unacceptable  

So when should we use it? 
 -Problems with too many rules 
 -Continually changing environments, adjust to new scenarios  
 -Large dataset, discovering insights
