Machine learning (non-DL) 
 -Structured data (tables, standardized rows and columns)  

Deep learning 
 -Unstructured data (data that is all over the place, blogs, images, sounds) 
 -turn unstructured to structured with neural networks (Neural networks, fully connected neural network, 
  convulutional neural network) 

Neural networks 
 -Web of tiny "brains" that connect to each other that learn to make decisions through examples  
 -Turn data (images, text, audio) into numbers (numerical encoding/matrix), parse into neural network 
  (choose appropriate neural network/representation output), into human understood output 

Anatomy 
 -Data -> Input layer (2) -> Hidden layer (as many as you want) -> Output layer (1 outputs learned 
  representation or prediction probabilities)  
 -Each layer is set of linear and/or non-linear functions that parse matrix   

Different learning models 
 1.Supervised: Data Labels, a lot of data and inputs for examples of what it should look like and to discern
 2.Unsupervised: Only Data, learn and inherent fundamental patterns between different examples, take what they 
   get and manipulate it in regards to what you expect
 3.Transfer: Taking patterns that one model learned from a dataset, and transferring it to another model 

What is Deep learning used for? 
 -Used to automatically learn patterns from data to make decisions and predictions 
 -ex: Youtube recommendations, google translate, speech recognition, NLP, spam detection 

Tensors 
 -Any representation of numbers  

PyTorch 
 -Programming library that provides tools for building and training machine learning models, e
  nabling computers to learn patterns and make decisions based on data 

PyTorch workflow  
 1.Get data ready (turn into tensors)
 2.Build or pick a pretrained model (to suit your problem)
   2.1 Pick a loss function & optimizer
   2.2 Build a training loop
 3.Fit the model to the data and make a prediction
 4.Evaluate the model
 5.Improve through experimentation
 6.Save and reload your trained model
